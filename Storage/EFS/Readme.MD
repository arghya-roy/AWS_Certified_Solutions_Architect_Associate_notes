- The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is the only storage solution in the list that provides a file system interface. It also supports millions of files as requested.
- EFS uses NFS (Network File System) protocol and FsX uses SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.
- EFS and FsX both are file system not block.

## A Solutions Architect needs to design a solution for providing a shared file system for company users in the AWS Cloud. The solution must be fault tolerant and should integrate with the companyâ€™s Microsoft Active Directory for access control. Which storage solution meets these requirements?
### ANS -
- Create a file system with Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and enable Multi-AZ. Join Amazon FSx to Active Directory.
- ** "Create an Amazon EFS file system and configure AWS Single Sign-On with Active Directory" is incorrect. You cannot configure AWS SSO for an EFS file system with Active Directory.**
