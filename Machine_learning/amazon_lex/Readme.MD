### Amazon Lex: (same technology that powers Alexa)
- Amazon Lex is a web service that allows customers to include conversational interfaces for voice and text in the software applications they are developing. The service, which uses the technology that powers Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa, is part of Amazon's artificial intelligence suite (Amazon AI). 
- Lex's deep learning algorithms allow a developer to build a conversational bot (chatbot) with an artificial personality. Lex uses automatic speech recognition to convert speech to text, natural language processing to understand spoken instruction and user intent, AWS Lambda for intent fulfillment, Amazon Cognito for user authentication and Amazon Polly for text to speech. AWS Mobile Hub can be used to automatically provision bots from a template.
